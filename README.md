# Project Name

Weekend Challenge: jQuery Salary Calculator
Created an application that records inputted employee info, then calculates and reports monthly salary costs.

## Description

The application takes in inputs of employee name, id, title, and annual salary.  Using a submit button, the inputs are transferred to the DOM and the inputs are cleared to allow for additional employee input.  When employee info is transferred to a table in the DOM, the monthly salary cost of all employees is summed and displayed in the DOM as well.
A delete button is included for each employee to remove that specific employee from the DOM.  The total monthly salary cost is readjusted to reflect the fired employee.
